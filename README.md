# Website Generator

A single-file [Zig](https://ziglang.org) project to generate static html and [gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) pages for my website from markdown-ish sytax.

By keeping the functionality simple an the code structure straightfoward, adding and removing features becomes a straightfoward and inviting task. Rather than building a library of common tools or writing extensions or plugins, I want to keep the scope small enough that new variations for kinds of websites could be copy & paste clones with custom tweaks.
