<p> <a href="https://strangerelics.itch.io/queen-killer" >Queen-Killer</a > is a
rapid tabletop game of intrigue, betrayal, and romance for three or more
players. Fight for the throne, fall in love, or get bloody revenge in just an
hour of play.</p>
<p> Originally made as part of the <a
href="https://200wordrpg.github.io/">200-word rpg challenge</a>, I polished it
up into a full game a year later and published it as my first completed rpg
project! Despite how simple the core premise is, I was really surprised to find
out how delightful it is play</p>

<p> I've been releasing
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3j3onOOPLU">a series of ambient synth
music videos</a>
on youtube. They're pretty good!</p>
<p> An interesting consequence of modular synthesis is that it's really hard to
rebuild a patch once you've messed with it. I've decided to embrace this
impermanence and produce each of my videos in a single evening. No looking back
– the mistakes add character.</p>
